This is week number 3 for my Collab Lab project.
Since week 1, I have been contributing by adding different features to our app. I've had the opportunity to pair with all the developers in the team on these issues.

Last Sunday, we had our first team retrospective, so I am sharing here some personal thoughts after spending some time reflecting on the job done so far.

‚ú® One of my goals when joining The Collab Lab was to refresh and deepen my React knowledge, so I am glad I am making progress in that sense. Also, I was missing the collaborative part of the development process, so I am really enjoying the teamwork.

üí™üèΩ I am also learning a lot from the collaboration process and feel quite confident using GitHub. The team is communicating very well, and the project is well on track.

üöß I am always looking forward to improving my communication skills and becoming more confident when presenting my work at the demos.

## Learning highlights of my week

My learnings have been focusing on React, this week I continued my [React's blog post series](https://dev.to/vivitt/series/26502) with the useMemo hook that was new for me and is a solution to improve app performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations, especially when working with slow methods or large amounts of data.

See you next week! Thanks for reading :)
