<div class="about centered">
<p>
I am a collaborative team player <span role='img' aria-label='soccer ball' aria-hidden="true">⚽️</span> who can quickly adapt to new environments and tasks. I am keen <span role='img' aria-label='eyes' aria-hidden="true">👀</span> on design details and empathize with the user's perspective.
</p>
<p>
I completed a software engineering internship at the Wikimedia Foundation and participated as a frontend developer at The Collab Lab.

I am interested in technical writting and documentation. Also I love to share what I learn, so I started a blog <span role='img' aria-label='notebook' aria-hidden="true">📓</span> where you can find <a href="/blog/">a series of articles on web development, accessibility, and my experiences transitioning into tech</a>.
