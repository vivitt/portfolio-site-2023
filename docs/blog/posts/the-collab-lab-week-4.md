I have already finished week 4 in [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/). I am glad to see the project taking shape, with the issues becoming more complex. As a team, we have still managed to deliver the new features on time.

This week, I want to highlight a great moment in the weekly schedule and one of my favorite aspects of participating in this project - the ✨ Office Hours ✨ .

These are optional weekly sync meetings where you can share your questions, concerns, or ideas, whether they are related to the project or not.

I find this space truly helpful and have already gained valuable insights from other participants, not only about my project-related questions but also regarding career-related issues.

Having a safe space where you can freely share anything and receive guidance from mentors is a privilege, and it really generates a supportive environment.

Apart from the project work, it's definitely one of the aspects I would highlight to anyone considering participating in future cohorts.

## Learning highlights of my week

I have been working on an issue that pushed me to learn about the Date object in JavaScript. This led me to write two blog posts during the week to document my learnings:

- [Learning about Date objects in JS](https://dev.to/vivitt/learning-about-date-objects-in-js-56l1)
- [JavaScript Date: calculating elapsed time](https://dev.to/vivitt/javascript-date-calculating-elapsed-time-5bfl)

Simultaneously, I have been working on a draft for another article for my React Hooks series, taking a deep dive into the useState hook.

See you next week! Thanks for reading :)
