# Some of my learnings from the Software Crafters Barcelona 10th edition
I had the opportunity to attend the Software Crafters Barcelona event last weekend. It was the 10th edition but for me, it was my first in-person tech event so I wanted to share some of my learnings and thoughts from this experience.

### Junior 2.0

The event started on Friday with an open-space discussion. I joined a group talking about a subject proposed by Concha Asensio: the challenges of transitioning to the tech field bringing years of experience from another field, which is my current situation.

The conversation went around how to manage expectations when you are a junior again and your impact is not the one that you used to have in your previous field. How is it possible in this scenario to leverage all your existing skills to provide real value to your team?

As a takeaway from this conversation:

strive for a safe space where you can have open conversations with managers and mentors. Is key to distinguishing between expectations from your manager and team and the ones that you are setting

be proactive and look for opportunities where your existing skills can be needed

stay open to learning and sharing what you know, it can be useful for others

### Making an impact at any level in your career

During day two, the day of talks, Maria Calzada shared cool insights on how to have an impact whatever it is your level.

She talked about three pillars that are the basis of making a meaningful impact and shared examples of how her team adopted these practices:

mindset: everything goes through our mind and is key to choosing from where we want to approach what we face

measurement: the only way to keep improving is to measure

teamwork: be able to show vulnerability and keep egos in place

One of the things that I found useful was the idea of the responsibility ladder, which you can use to figure out where are you standing in a specific situation:

### Ideation to integration

This was a workshop session by Daniel Phillips, Head of Engineering at Trainline. He shared with us their approach to delivering high-quality software, from the idea to the merge of a pull request.

We discussed the importance of thinking far-off coding to adopt a problem-solving-focused approach, as well as embracing collaboration and the importance of setting from the beginning on the same page with all the team members.

During the session, one of the things we talked about was the importance of having clear acceptance criteria defined upfront to start working on a specific requirement. Well-defined acceptance criteria will provide clear guidelines to developers but also will align the expectations and smooth communication among the team because it will reduce misinterpretations of the requirements. It will also contribute to having a clear basis to test against, as it will be clear when a product or feature is working as expected.

### Pair programming

On Sunday I joined a session about pair programming hosted by Elena Navarro Molina and Josep Ma Rocamona. Even though I could only join at the final part of the session, it was truly useful to learn more about the different roles involved, benefits, and common anti-patterns that can get in the way and prevent us from getting the most out of our sessions.

For me, defining these roles thoughtfully was particularly helpful. I always learn a lot from pair programming sessions and this workshop provided useful strategies to better prepare for and have more productive pair sessions.

------------------------------

Software Crafters Barcelona is an event with a warm and welcoming atmosphere that made me feel comfortable from the first moment.

If you are new to the tech feel, attending an in-person event is an excellent opportunity to learn new things and expand your network.

For me, it was a great experience to listen to interesting talks and ask questions to more experienced engineers. Additionally, it was very positive to connect with new people, share experiences, and feel supported by the community.

So before summing up, I wanted to express my gratitude to the organizers. I am looking forward to attending more events like this in the future.
