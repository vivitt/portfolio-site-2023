I am a creative frontend developer, with a background in audiovisual and visual communication <span role='img' aria-label='woman technologist' aria-hidden="true">👩🏽‍💻</span>.

<p>
I am passionate <span role='img' aria-label='heart' aria-hidden="true">💗</span> about developing enjoyable experiences that make the web more accessible and inclusive.
</p>
<p>
I am a collaborative team player <span role='img' aria-label='soccer ball' aria-hidden="true">⚽️</span> who can quickly adapt to new environments and tasks. I am keen <span role='img' aria-label='eyes' aria-hidden="true">👀</span> on design details and empathize with the user's perspective.
