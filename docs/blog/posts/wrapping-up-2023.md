As we reach the last week of 2023, it is a nice time to reflect on the significant achievements of the year. For me, 2023 was a year of first-time experiences and I'd like to take this opportunity to reflect on what I accomplished this year and the journey that got me to where I am today.

Here are my main milestones:

- **First Professional Experience as a Software Engineer**

    I joined the Wikimedia Foundation at the beginning of the year as a Software Engineering Intern in the Growth team. It was a transformative experience and it is hard to measure all the learnings I kept from those months. Apart from all the technical knowledge I gained (I published [two blog posts on Diff](https://diff.wikimedia.org/?s=Viviana+Yanez), where you will find details on the work I have been doing), I was eager to immerse myself in the use of tech team tools and methodologies within a real-world environment. Working with a team also helped me to be aware of my strengths and address areas for improvement. I spent a few months surrounded by amazing people who shared their experience and knowledge with me, and I could not imagine a better way to kickstart my developer journey.

- **I attended a software conference for the first time**

    I had the opportunity to attend the [Barcelona Software Crafters](https://softwarecrafters.barcelona/) event for the first time this year and I really enjoyed it. Attending conferences wasn't a top priority for me, but I discovered that it's a great way to learn new things, discover emerging trends, and most importantly, meet new people. I wrote a blog post to share my experience and I'm looking forward to attending more events like this in 2024.

- **Started my blog**
    
    I love to share what I learn and I am convinced that you truly know something when you can explain it to others, so I found that blogging is a perfect practice that covers both. Also, as it had been a long time since the last time I wrote something, it was truly rewarding remembering that it is something I really enjoy. 
    Writing allows me to take the time to reflect on what I want to say and it is also an incredible tool for finding out what you are struggling to understand. Moreover, if my writing can benefit others, it brings me an extra dose of joy and satisfaction. 
    This is one of the things I want to keep doing and improving during 2024.

One of the things that I have come to love the most about having transitioned my career to tech, is the willingness of people to share their knowledge and support others. Throughout this year, there have been several resources that have been crucial to my growth and development:

- I joined [ADPList](https://adplist.org/) and  [Step4ward](https://step4ward.notion.site/step4ward/Bienvenidas-a-Step4ward-2b133826a10a4fc6a5bc7686605f6357) and received mentoring sessions that helped me overcome challenges and concerns. I found these mentoring relationships incredibly valuable and a great source of learning and growth. Definitely one of the things I prioritize to keep doing during 2024.

- I have also joined the [TechFems](https://techfems.org/) community in Barcelona, and couldnâ€™t be happier to have found a place of support and share with other women in tech.

- Finally, I want to mention some of the blogs and amazing tech content creators I have been following and enjoying lately:
   - [Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/), talks about design engineering focusing on accessibility.
   - [Julia Undeutsch](https://dev.to/yuridevat), talks about accessibility, frontend development and breaking into tech.
   - [Kitty Giraudel](https://kittygiraudel.com/blog/), talks about frontend development focusing on accessibility, diversity and inclusion.
   - [Kate Marshalkina](https://kalabro.tech/), talks about software engineering and career development.

Certainly, not everything went as planned during the year, and I am taking those experiences as valuable lessons for the future. I believe the most crucial lesson I kept is that a career in software engineering is not a short-term goal, but rather a long-term commitment. So it becomes essential to build upon a strong foundation and grow consistent, sustainable habits.

As I continue my search for a full-time role as a frontend developer, I am excited to keep sharing what I learn through my blog and also start volunteering as a tech coach for women just entering the field.

I am extremely grateful to all the people who have shared their time and experience with me, supporting my growth as a developer during this year.

Envisioning a 2024 full of learning, joy, creativity, daring, and more first-times for all!
