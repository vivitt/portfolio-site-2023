## Journey

I have always been curious about drawing with CSS, so this was the perfect opportunity to get started.

- I learned about using the [clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path) property to create custom shapes. This property adds a clipping region to set which part of an element is shown.

- I also used the [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) ::before and ::after, which provide two additional boxes to add details to the drawing without adding more elements to the markup.

- Finally, I wanted to create a bit of texture in my drawing, so I came across this great article where I learned how to add a grainy gradient using SVG. [this great article, where I learn how to add a grainy gradient using SVG](https://css-tricks.com/grainy-gradients/).
