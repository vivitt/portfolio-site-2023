<p>
Hello! I am Viviana <span aria-hidden="true">👋🏽</span>, creative web developer.
</p>

<p>
I wrote my first lines of code while working as a 2D character animator and years later, I decided to fully transition my career into this field.

<p>
My interests include creativity, culture, technical writing, knowledge sharing... I love the intersection between design and engineering, and my work always takes a user-centric approach. I care about crafting enjoyable experiences that make the web more accessible and inclusive.
</p>

<p>
I am a collaborative team player <span aria-hidden="true">⚽️</span> who can quickly adapt to new environments and tasks. 
During the last months, I completed a software engineering internship at the Wikimedia Foundation and participated as a frontend developer at The Collab Lab.
