I have created a customized cover template for my blog posts, which includes a background image with the title and date of the post. This adds a personal touch to my website and also maintains a visual consistency.

However, creating and uploading these images for each post can be time-consuming. So, I really wanted a solution to generate these images dynamically.

---

After researching, I found that the Canvas API could help.

I was inspired by [a great series of blog posts](https://uxdesign.cc/the-sharing-part-1-generating-and-sharing-dynamic-images-on-the-web-d43dace87802) and decided to adapt the approach to my needs. In this blog post, I will go over the solution I used in my [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) site but you can also check a more [basic example in this codepen](https://codepen.io/vivitt/pen/OJqQbox). 


### Intro to Canvas API
The [canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) provides a way for drawing graphics using Javascript and HTML.

It is focused on 2D graphics and is commonly used for animation, games, dynamic charts and data visualization, generative art, among others. Provides an set of methods for drawing pixels (in the form of lines, shapes, images, and/or text) in the screen inside an HTML ``<canvas>`` element.

### Base image
To begin with, I created the image to be used as a background. It is where the dynamic data such as the blog post title and date will be added, and can be either a PNG or a SVG file.

This is mine:
<div class="blog__illustration">
    <img  src="/assets/article-cover.svg"/>
</div>

### Image and font preload
After that I need to make sure that my assets are loaded before showing anything. So, I created a function to load the image:

        async function loadImage(url) {
        	return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        		const image = new Image();
            	image.onload = () => resolve(elem);
        		image.onerror = reject;
        		image.crossOrigin = â€˜Anonymous';
        		image.src = url;
        	});
        }


And another one for loading the font I wanted to use in my cover images: 

        async function loadFont(fontFamily, url) {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        		const face = new FontFace(fontFamily, url);
            	face.onload = () => document.fonts.add(face);
                resolve()
        		face.onerror = reject;
        	});
        }

### Generating the image
Then I created the function that actually generates the image. 
The first step is to create a ```<canvas>``` element:

        const generateCover = () => {
            const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
            canvas.height = 840;
            canvas.width = 1600;
            //... 
        
          
Then, I get the context of this element, using the ```getContext``` method. This is where the drawing will be rendered:

            const context = canvas.getContext("2d");

Now the canvas environment is set up, and I can start drawing into it. I used another method to add my background image into the context:

            context.drawImage(cover.value, 0, 0);

Next, I want to write the blog post title and date. With the [```font``` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/font), I set the size and font-family I want to use. And with the [```textBaseline``` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/textBaseline) set the alignment for the text:

            context.font = "96px Modak";
            context.textBaseline = 'top';

The [```fillText``` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillText) draws a text string and accepts four parameters: the ```text``` to draw, the ```x-axis``` coordinate in pixels where begin drawing the text, the ```y-axis``` coordinate in pixels where begin drawing the text, the ```maxWidth``` is an optional parameter to set a maximum number of pixels for the whole text to take widely once rendered[^1]:

            context.fillText(`${blogPostTitle}`, 173, 250, 1400);



The last step in the function is returning the generated image, using the [```toDataURL``` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL). This method returns a dataURL with the image representation, in the format determined by the param:

            const dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg');
            return dataUrl;
        }
        

Finally, I am able to use the image like this:

    <img src="generateCover()" alt="" width="1600" height="840" />


Here a codepen with a Vue.js example.

### A11y note
As a final comment, maybe you noted that I am letting the "alt" attribute of the cover image blank in my implementation. This is because I have included the blog post title as a ```<h1>``` tag just after the cover image. In this way, screen readers will not read the image as it does not provide any new information. However, if you opt not to include the image text or if your image provides additional information to users, it is important to include an "alt" attribute.

[^1]: With the CanvasAPI we are writing pixels, so I had to make some Javascript calculation to add line breaks to the title when needed before it is drawn, to make sure it only takes the place I want it to take inside the image.
